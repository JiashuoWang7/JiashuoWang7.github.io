            <h2>1. Geographic Information</h2>
            <p>The Qin Dynasty originated in the Wei River Valley, in modern-day Shaanxi Province. The region's fertile plains and proximity to the Yellow River provided a strong agricultural base, allowing the Qin state to grow in power. During Qin Shi Huang's reign, the territory expanded significantly, encompassing much of China’s central plains, southern regions, and extending to the northern frontier where the Great Wall was constructed to defend against nomadic invaders.</p>

                <li><strong>Infrastructure Projects</strong>: The dynasty undertook massive projects, including road networks and canals, improving connectivity across the empire.</li>

        <section id="society">
            <h2>5. Social Structure and Government</h2>
            <p>The Qin Dynasty established a centralized bureaucratic government that replaced the old feudal system. The society was strictly hierarchical:</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Soldiers</strong>: Played a crucial role in maintaining order and defending the state.</li>
                <li><strong>Peasants</strong>: Formed the backbone of the economy, working the land and paying taxes.</li>
                <li><strong>Laborers and Artisans</strong>: Contributed to massive state projects like the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Legalism was the guiding philosophy, emphasizing strict laws and harsh punishments to maintain control and order.</p>
